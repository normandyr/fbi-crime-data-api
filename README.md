# fbi-crime-data-api
Final Project during 12/2018 just now getting around to uploading.  Completed with a partner

The Twitter Share button is not functioning at the moment.  I haven't looked at this level of javascript in over a year 
and I'm not sure which package is leverage javascript promises.  I believe it is passport but will have to look at this at a 
later date.

Current version able for access via:

https://fbi-crime-api.herokuapp.com/about

HOWEVER - the site is not completely functional.  A majority of functionality exists but background, images, styles not up.  Some resource pages being served won't work, Twitter login/callback is currently disabled as trying to fit into using heroku app callback and not the localhost callback url.

Current Completion 75%
